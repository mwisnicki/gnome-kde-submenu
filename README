= KDE submenu for "Applications" menu of GNOME panel

== How does it work
Modifies user's applications.menu file to merge two generated files:
1. applications-kde4-exclude.menu - exclude from standard menus any entry
   with KDE category.
2. applications-kde4-submenu.menu - adds submenu called KDE with contents and
   layout of standard KDE menu, containing only entries in KDE category to
   avoid duplicates.

Tested on Ubuntu 9.10, for other distributions you may need to adjust paths in
Makefile.

== Requirements
- make
- xsltproc

  sudo apt-get install make xsltproc

== Installation
Execute as *normal* user:
  make install
Your original applications.menu is backed up with '~' suffix.

== Removal
  make deinstall
If backed up applications.menu~ exist it will be restored

== Bugs
1. Doing 'make install' twice will overwrite your backup and you will lose your
   own menu customizations (if you had any).
